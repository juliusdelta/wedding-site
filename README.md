# Wedding Site

This project is the website/application for my wedding invitations, reservations, mailers, and text messaging reminders. 

## Structure
There's a `frontend` and `backend` folders.

### Frontend
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

### Backend
- [GraphQL Yoga]('https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga')
- [Prisma]('https://prisma.io')
- PostgresQL via Prisma

To run the project, cd into each of the frontend and backend directories and run `npm install`. You'll need to have environment variables properly configured with a Prisma endpoint.
